Full vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of network hosts, services, and firewalls with risk ratings and remediation guidance. (nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, pfSense, Snort)

Mobile Application Security Testing
Static and dynamic analysis of Android/iOS apps to identify insecure storage, code flaws and dangerous permissions. (Mobexler, MobSF, JADX)

API & Backend Security Testing
Targeted testing of REST/GraphQL APIs for authentication, authorization, and injection vulnerabilities. (Burp Suite, Postman, custom Python scripts)

Cloud & Configuration Reviews
Evaluation of cloud configurations and host hardening recommendations to reduce attack surface and misconfigurations. (Linux, Bash, PowerShell, policy checks)

Endpoint Security Assessment & Remediation
Audit endpoints for misconfigurations, missing patches and weak controls; provide remediation playbook and configuration hardening. (Wazuh, security onion, EDR guidance)
